# EALP-Token

Ethereum Alps with ticker "EALP" is an open source peer-to-peer and business-to-customer decentralised digital currency, 
which unlike those of traditional banks and financial institutions is viewable and easily audited by anyone. 
The blockchain of Ethereum Alps offers secure, instant, decentralised and private transactions. EALP token is fully 
ERC20-compliant, ensuring that it is supported by all major wallets and exchanges.
The main idea behind creating our project is to have Ethereum Alps accepted as a payment digital currency in the top-rated 
Alpine touristic sites in all the Alpine states: France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Italy, Monaco, Liechtenstein, and 
Slovenia. The Alps are the largest mountain chain in Europe, extending for almost 1,000 km. The Alps are the ideal destination
for a whole host of leisure and outdoor activities â€“ skiing, hiking, mountaineering, white water rafting, pot-holing, mountain
biking, visiting thermal baths and much more besides!. With about 375 million overnight stays per year, the Alps count as one
of the most tourism-intense regions in the world, situated in a geographically and climatically perfect environment. Our 
long-term goal is not only to have Ethereum Alps widely accepted and adopted in the Alpine region, but also to create a new 
union gathering all the Alpine states around a new innovative project in which Ethereum Alps is the major player.


EALP Token Features:
1. Fast: Ethereum Alps runs on the speed of the Ethereum blockchain, which has faster confirmation time than Bitcoin due 
   to the GHOST protocol. The average confirmation time is only 24 seconds, while it may go up to several minutes or several 
   hours when using Bitcoin. This means that, with a 15 second block time, roughly 40 Ethereum blocks are needed to match the 
   60 minutes that 6 Bitcoin blocks take.

2. Low Fees: You can buy and sell all kinds of goods or services using Ethereum Alps while paying very low fees. Transaction 
   fees on the blockchain of a lot of other cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin) are quite expensive even for small or micro 
   transactions. The blockchain of Ethereum Alps has an average transaction fee from $0.20 to $0.50, making it more suitable 
   to put more money into the pockets of businesses.

3. Very Limited Supply: The total supply is strictly limited to only 3,000,000 EALP. 27% of the total supply (810,000 EALP) 
   will be airdropped to only 2,000 participants. 20% of the total supply (600,000 EALP) will be held and paid out to 120 token
   holders via the Holder Program (6 distribution rounds). Our team is visionary in the way it adopts a new strategy to ensure 
   a constant increasing in the value of EALP once it is listed on exchanges.

4. Anonymous & Secure: Banks and other traditional financial institutions always require to keep a record of transactions and 
   also a record of personal information of all their customers. Ethereum Alps provides absolute anonymity as it is built as a 
   smart contract on the Ethereum network. Transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are both anonymous and secure, with no 
   central authority, and no personal information record.
